# Data Processing for Room Temperature Axial Compression Tests

The repository contains codes to process data from Room Temperature Axial Compression Tests. The code was generated for 6in TCP Qualification. 

The Data for RT Axial Compression Tests are stored in DMS 61334.

Coupons from pipe 3678-006-4 were used for 6in TCP qualification of RT Axial Compression test. 

The code generates plots for 
a) String Put Axial Strain vs Time
b) Failure Load vs String Pot Strain
c) Stress vs String Pot Strain
d) Axial Strain vs Time
e) Hoop Strain vs Time
f) Stress vs Axial Strain
g) Stress vs Hoop Strain
h) Stress vs Strain
i) Axial Stress vs Strain along fibre direction
j) Axial Stress vs Strain transverse to fibre direction
k) Axial Stress vs Surface fibre shear strain
l) Axial Stress vs Max Principal Strain
m) Axial Stress vs Min Principal Strain
n) Axial Stress vs Principal Angle
o) Axial Stress vs Max Shear Strain
p), q) Modulus plots of Axial and Hoop Strain vs Time 
r) Axial Compression Modulus graph
s) Yield Point measurement
t) Poisson's ratio vs Axial Strain
